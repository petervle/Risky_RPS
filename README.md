# Risky_RPS
Risky_RPS stands for Risky Rock-Paper-Scissors. A project I am currently working on.

# Background
My friends and I play this game that we have given no name to. We set a punishment for the other person, then we play a game. The loser of the game takes the punishment, and the game must be something that requires little to no skill (like rock-paper-scissors).
We can still play the game if we're video chatting (covid-19 is happening at this time), but a virtual version of the game could be cool too. I don't know, I'll build it and we'll find out.

# Instructions
instructions for my non-tech friends will be put here.

# Rules/Scope of Project
1. Regular RPS rules
2. Before playing we both select an image for each other that will be posted onto the loser's social media

# Learning goals
1. Making automated Facebook (or other social media) posts.
2. Connecting to an online network. Figure out how two remote people can play the game.
3. A decent looking UI for my friends that are not so tech oriented. Not everyone can use a terminal.
4. Organization. Let's look to create a file to manage the posts, one to manage the gameplay, one to manage the UI, and one to manage the network.
